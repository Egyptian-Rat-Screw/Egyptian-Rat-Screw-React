Development Enviornment: 

- Create React App with an Express Backend ( https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/ )  
  * I used this guide previously to build a fullstack react app.

- Using create-react-app with React Router + Express.js ( https://medium.com/@patriciolpezjuri/using-create-react-app-with-react-router-express-js-8fa658bf892d )  
  * This guide seems similar to the one above and can also be utilized.  

- How to get "create-react-app" to work with your API ( https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/ )  
  * This article seems relevant 

- Use create-react-app as a full-stack tool, with Express and Sequelize (PostgreSQL) ( https://github.com/ekatzenstein/create-react-app-fullstack )  
  * The Stack    
      -PostgreSQL  
      -Sequelize  
      -Node/Express.js  
      -React  
      -Redux  
      -React-Router   
  ( 12/14/2017 | Joe Mulick | I was not able to get this particular guide to work properly; It was not recognizing the fullstack command.. Explanation in the github repo seems poor. )
